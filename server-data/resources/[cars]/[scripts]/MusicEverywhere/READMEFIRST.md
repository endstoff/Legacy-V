[Hello and thanks for buying the script :) You can't imagine how grateful I am.]

In order to have the script 100% functional you should always use the Xogos library, xsound this is the link:
https://github.com/Xogy/xsound

After that you should always go to the file transid.lua and put your REFERENCE Id there, which should be given when you buy the script.
If you do not put the reference id the script will not work correctly

After that the script will be functional, and for any problem you should always contact me on discord :)
