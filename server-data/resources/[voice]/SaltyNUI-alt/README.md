# SaltyNUI
Discourage Users without Temspeak running when using SaltyChat!


The goal of this simple Lua scirpt is to block Player from moving & display a black screen when your Server is using the SaltyChat System but the the Player isnt online on your Teamspeak Server similar to TokoVoip's one.

## What is Saltychat?
SaltyChat is an Open-Source Community Supported Proximity Chat system using a Teamspeak Server instead of the GTA-V Voice Chat. 
It offers many features besides the Proximity Chat like Radio Channels and Private Phone Calls.

[Download SaltyChat](https://github.com/saltminede/saltychat-fivem)

## How to Install?
### Basic Installation
- Download the latest Release of SaltyNUI
- Rename the Downloaded Folder to "saltynui"
- Copy the Folder into your ressources/ folder

On the Basic Installation SaltyNUI only gets triggered when u mute your Microphone. To get triggered when Player is in Wrong Server/Channel or isnt even Online you need the Advanced Installation!

   BaseScript.TriggerEvent("SaltyNUI:TsActive");
 }else{
   BaseScript.TriggerEvent("SaltyNUI:TsNotActive");
 } 
```
to the OnMessage Event (under case Command.StateUpdate)
It should look somethings like [THIS](https://screens.egopvp.com/files/2020/05/30/devenv_58LaZ8WVeJ.png) 

- Goto Line 500 and add `BaseScript.TriggerEvent("SaltyNUI:TsNotActive");` to the OnDisconnected Event (It should look like [THIS](https://screens.egopvp.com/files/2020/05/30/devenv_g5rbAJWpAH.png))
