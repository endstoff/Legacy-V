# SaltyNUI
Discourage Users without Temspeak running when using SaltyChat!


The goal of this simple Lua scirpt is to block Player from moving & display a black screen when your Server is using the SaltyChat System but the the Player isnt online on your Teamspeak Server similar to TokoVoip's one.

## What is Saltychat?
SaltyChat is an Open-Source Community Supported Proximity Chat system using a Teamspeak Server instead of the GTA-V Voice Chat. 
It offers many features besides the Proximity Chat like Radio Channels and Private Phone Calls.

[Download SaltyChat](https://github.com/saltminede/saltychat-fivem)

## How to Install?
### Basic Installation
- Download the latest Release of SaltyNUI
- Rename the Downloaded Folder to "saltynui"
- Copy the Folder into your ressources/ folder
- Add `ensure saltynui` to your server.cfg and make sure the NUI is started AFTER SaltyChat.

On the Basic Installation SaltyNUI only gets triggered when u mute your Microphone. To get triggered when Player is in Wrong Server/Channel or isnt even Online you need the Advanced Installation!
