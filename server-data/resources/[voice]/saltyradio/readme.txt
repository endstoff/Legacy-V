**QUICK DESCRIPTION, WAHT IT DOES**
It adds a radio to the server where players can communicate with each other across the map. Players can join in frequencies and also save them as favorites. In the config of the script you can also set encrypted frequencies, so you can join only by a certain job.

### Installation
There is an Readme File in it please read it.

### Info

⠀ ⠀ » Since the radio has been dumped or stolen by almost every german server, we decided to publish the script. Mainly because the people who dumped it then decided to sell it as well. 
           In cooperation with Doxylamin.
